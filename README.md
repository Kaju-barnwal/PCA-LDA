üç∑ Wine Quality Analysis with PCA & LDA

üìå Project Overview

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on the Wine Quality dataset (WineQT.csv) to explore dimensionality reduction and classification techniques in R.
Problem Statement: Wine quality is influenced by multiple physicochemical properties. Understanding how these features contribute to wine classification can help in quality control and production optimization.

Goal:

Reduce dimensionality using PCA and interpret the variance explained by principal components.
Classify wine quality using LDA (both multiclass and binary Fisher‚Äôs LDA).
Compare accuracy, visualize discriminant functions, and derive insights for real-world applications.

üìä Dataset Description ‚Äì WineQT

Observations: 1,143 wines
Variables: 13 (12 features + 1 target variable + Id)

Features include:
Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, Free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol

Target Variable: quality (integer score between 3‚Äì8, later treated as a factor for classification)
Id: Unique identifier (removed during modeling)

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

R (base)
ggplot2 ‚Äì Visualization (scatter plots, scree plots, projections)
MASS ‚Äì LDA modeling
stats ‚Äì PCA (prcomp), covariance & eigen decomposition

üîé Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
Removed ID column (not predictive).
Converted quality to a categorical factor for classification.
Standardized numerical features using scale().

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Automatic PCA with prcomp():
Computed principal components and variance explained.
Generated scree plot and cumulative variance plots.
Visualized the first two PCs with a scatter plot colored by wine quality.

Manual PCA (Eigen Decomposition):
Computed covariance matrix.
Extracted eigenvalues (variance explained) & eigenvectors (PC loadings).
Verified consistency with automatic PCA results.

3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Multiclass LDA:

Modeled wine quality across all categories.
Extracted discriminant coefficients and functions.
Evaluated classification accuracy with a confusion matrix.

Binary Fisher‚Äôs LDA:

Compared two selected quality groups (e.g., quality 5 vs 6).
Projected data onto discriminant axis.
Visualized using scatter plots & histograms.

üìà Results & Visualizations

PCA

Variance Explained:

PC1 explained ~28.7% variance, PC2 ~17.1%, PC3 ~14.3%.
First 5 PCs captured ~80% of total variance.

Key Visualizations:
Scree plots (automatic & manual) showed clear elbow after ~5 PCs.
Scatter plot of PC1 vs PC2 revealed clustering patterns by quality.

LDA

Multiclass LDA:
Extracted 5 discriminant functions.
Accuracy moderately improved over random guessing (~best for mid-quality wines).

Binary Fisher‚Äôs LDA (5 vs 6):
Clear separation on discriminant axis.
Accuracy higher than multiclass scenario.

Visualizations:

Projection scatter plots and histograms demonstrated separation across quality groups.
